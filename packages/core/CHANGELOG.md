### Minor Changes

- [#401](https://github.com/crs48/xNet/pull/401) [`92708ab`](https://github.com/crs48/xNet/commit/92708ab09f2334b1ee02fef4cea654c1aed6b0ed) Thanks [@crs48](https://github.com/crs48)! - Add the shared Last-Write-Wins ordering module to `@xnetjs/core`
  (`compareChangeApplicationOrder`, `compareLwwStamps`, `lwwWins`,
  `lwwUpdateGuardSql`, `LwwStamp`) — the single canonical LWW comparison used
  across the stack (protocol §L1.7).

  `@xnetjs/data`, `@xnetjs/plugins`, and `@xnetjs/react` adopt it and receive
  internal decompositions of their most-churned modules (NodeStore query
  compiler/hydration/transaction execution, ai-surface tool registry and
  resource URI router, XNetProvider provider units). No public API changes in
  those packages.

### Minor Changes

- [#284](https://github.com/crs48/xNet/pull/284) [`d6d0470`](https://github.com/crs48/xNet/commit/d6d047022b8a77b7a3e7453869fb42cbeb73f4a4) Thanks [@crs48](https://github.com/crs48)! - Add shared dependency-free helpers to `@xnetjs/core` and unify the SSRF guard.

  `@xnetjs/core` now exports `clamp`, `clamp01`, `formatBytes`, and the
  literal-host SSRF guard (`assertPublicUrl`, `validateExternalUrl`, `SsrfError`),
  replacing several behaviour-identical copies that had drifted across packages —
  including byte formatters that silently capped at megabytes and a regex-based
  URL guard that missed private ranges (CGNAT, IPv4-mapped IPv6, NAT64, the
  `fe81::–fe8f::` link-local block, and the trailing-dot bypass).
  `@xnetjs/plugins` now delegates its outbound-action SSRF check to the canonical
  guard while keeping its `ActionSsrfError` contract; `@xnetjs/react` byte
  displays no longer cap at megabytes.

### Patch Changes

- cd2a564: Set up automated npm publishing via Changesets and GitHub Actions trusted publishing, and standardize package publish metadata (public access, provenance, files, and dist entrypoints) for the initial @xnetjs release set including the React package chain.
