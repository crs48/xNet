/**
 * Schemas that intentionally carry no `authorization` block (exploration 0192).
 *
 * Every other registered schema must declare authorization (enforced by
 * `authorization-coverage.test.ts`). The schemas listed here are edge/system/
 * identity nodes whose access semantics deliberately differ from the Space
 * cascade and are governed elsewhere (the hub grant model, signed-content
 * federation, or per-user privacy):
 *
 * - `SpaceMembership` — an edge node; who may read/write a membership is the
 *   membership *admin* question, secured by the hub against the parent Space,
 *   not a cascade of the membership row itself.
 * - `Grant` — the capability record that the grant model is *made of*; gating
 *   it with the grant model would be circular. Hub-managed.
 * - `Profile` — public identity. Profiles must be readable by collaborators to
 *   render names/handles on shared content, so they are hub-published rather
 *   than Space-gated.
 * - `SchemaDefinition` / `SchemaCompatibility` / `SyncPolicy` — system /
 *   federation nodes; signed and content-addressed, governed by the schema
 *   authority resolution path, not per-node roles.
 * - `PresenceSummary` — ephemeral presence aggregate; visibility is handled by
 *   the presence pipeline.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth: `defineSchema` reads it to suppress the
 * dev-time legacy warning, and the coverage test reads it to allow these IRIs.
 * Both the versioned (canonical) and unversioned (legacy alias) IRIs are listed
 * so the check matches however a schema id is resolved.
